With golf club in hand you consider your next move. Do you: Option A: Hide and wait for the intruder and have the element of surprise? Option B: Confront the intruder."

You notice your phone on the floor next to your nightstand as you hear what sounds like footsteps approaching  Do you: Option A: Stay still and quiet? Maybe the intruder will leave. Option B: Use your cellphone to call 911? At the risk that the intruder may hear you."

You position yourself behind the door, weapon raised as you hear the creaking from the stairs and footsteps advancing towards your room, you see a figure reach in and press the light switch, the room illuminates. It's at that moment you realize the intruder is really your mother and you forgot to plug your lamp in. "

You turn the corner at the bottom and head towards the kitchen, you hear clanging and can see a shadowy figure lingering near the island. Hands shaking and heart racing, You yell 'GET OUT!' and flick on the light. Dishes slam to the ground as your Cat leaps from counter and runs out of the room. Now you can understand why some people hate cats "

They break down the door and come across a scene in which nightmares are made of...your body is never found."
